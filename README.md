# Neural Network
This neural network is trained by a large dataset of handwritten numbers (0 through 9). The GUI allows you to manually test the program, using your own handwritten numbers as test inputs. After guessing which number you wrote, the GUI also displays its degree of certainty, e.g. 0.871234 = there is an 87% chance that it guessed correctly, according to the learned model.

(This was an UN-assigned assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course. That is, the professor had written the assignment, but chose not to assign it so late in the semester. He released the document anyway, just in case anyone was still interested in doing it)

The files I wrote are `NeuralNetwork.java` and `Perceptron.java`; everything else was provided.
