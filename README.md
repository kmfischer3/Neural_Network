# Neural Network
This was an UNassigned assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course. That is, the professor had written the assignment but chose not to assign it so late in the semester. He released the document anyway, just in case anyone was still interested in doing it.

The files I wrote are `NeuralNetwork.java` and `Perceptron.java`; everything else was provided.
